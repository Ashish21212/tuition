## 1. Core System Setup
These are the foundational elements that must be in place before other features can be added.

### 1.1 User Authentication
a. Admin: Manage students, teachers, schedules, and payments.
b. Teacher: View classes, manage students, and track performance.
c. Student: View classes, check schedules, and access study materials.

### 1.2 Class Scheduling
a. Allow admins/teachers to create and manage class schedules.
b. Include notifications for class reminders.

### 1.3 Fee Management:
a. Fee payment tracking for students.
b. Generate receipts and manage payment history.

### 1.4 Performance Tracking:
a. Allow teachers to track student attendance and grades.
b. Provide students access to performance reports.

### Communication Tools:(Optional)
a. Messaging system for students and teachers.
b. Notifications for important updates.

### 2. Database Design
a. Create models for `User`, `classes`, `subject`, `fees`, `attendance`, `notifications`, `study materials`.
b. Set up necessary relationships between models 

### 3. Frontend and Backend


### 3.1 Frontend:
a. Use React for a dynamic and responsive interface.
b. Prioritize user experience with clear navigation and UI design.
### 3.2 Backend:
a. Use Express.js to build RESTful APIs for data communication.
b. Implement secure user authentication and authorization.

### 4. Authentication and Authorization
a. Secure login/signup for students, teachers, and admins.
b. Use JWT or sessions to manage user authentication.
c. Role-based access control (e.g., students cannot access admin functionality)

### 5. Payment Integration
a. Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for fee payments.
b. Track payment statuses and generate receipts.

### 6. Scalability and Performance (Later)
a.Use caching (e.g., Redis) to improve performance for repeated requests.
b.Plan for scalability, ensuring the app can handle a growing number of users.

### 7. Notifications and Alerts(Later)
a. Add email or SMS notifications for fee reminders, class schedules, or announcements.
b. Use libraries like Nodemailer or external services like Twilio.

### 8. Security
a. Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment info).
b. Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
c. Implement HTTPS for secure communication.

### 9. Testing
a. Test for edge cases and usability:
b. Unit testing: Test individual components and routes.
c. Integration testing: Test API endpoints.
d. Use tools like Jest, Postman, or Cypress.

### 10. Documentation
a. Maintain proper documentation for:
b. API endpoints.
c. Database schema.
d. Installation/setup guide for your project.
